In the process of making the main jypter notebook which is called **GN_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb** I used some python files to help with the funciton debugging and testing. This is simply because testing in Jypter is not as simple and easy as other softwar like PyCharm. 

## Again, the main file for the assingment is the GN_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb and all other files are misc. or outputs from my code.
